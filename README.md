# Disaster Simulation with Drone Navigation (CoppeliaSim Project)

## Overview

This project simulates a disaster-struck area filled with fallen trees, rocks, and other obstacles, using CoppeliaSim. 
A quadcopter (drone) equipped with an RGB-D camera navigates the area. 
The system supports manual control, dataset collection for AI training, and dynamic environment generation.

## Main Features

- üõ©Ô∏è **Drone control** (WASD + QE keyboard controls for movement and rotation)
- üì∑ **RGB-D Camera setup** (floating views for live RGB and depth images)
- üå≥ **Procedural disaster area generation** (rocks, standing/fallen trees)
- üõ†Ô∏è **Configuration menu** to adjust scene parameters at runtime
- üß† **Depth dataset collection** for future machine learning projects
- üéÆ **Interactive control menus** for creating, clearing, restarting scenes

## Setup Instructions

1. Install [CoppeliaSim 4.9.0](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads.html).
2. Make sure the `zmqRemoteApi` plugin is available (standard in 4.6+).
3. Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install coppeliasim-zmqremoteapi-client numpy
```

4. Start CoppeliaSim with a quadrotor scene containing:
   - `Quadcopter` model
   - `/target` dummy
   - `/propeller` children properly configured

5. Run the simulation from `main.py`:

```bash
python main.py
```

6. Use the keyboard to interact:
   - Use `W/A/S/D` + `Q/E` keys to move and rotate the drone.
   - Press `Enter` to open the menu.

## Controls

| Key  | Action |
|------|-------|
| `W`  | Move Forward |
| `S`  | Move Backward |
| `A`  | Strafe Left |
| `D`  | Strafe Right |
| `Q`  | Rotate Left (Yaw) |
| `E`  | Rotate Right (Yaw) |
| `Space` | Move Up |
| `Z`  | Move Down |

## Dataset Collection Behavior

- Depth images and drone poses are captured every N simulation frames.
- Each saved batch contains:
  - `depths`: Depth images
  - `poses`: Drone positions and orientations `[x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw]`
  - `frames`: Frame numbers
  - `distances`: Placeholder distances (currently always `-1.0`)
  - `actions`: Discrete movement/rotation labels
- Data is saved automatically in compressed `.npz` files.
- Dataset is split into `train/`, `val/`, and `test/` folders based on the configured ratio.

## Future Improvements

- Advanced obstacle avoidance AI (planned).
- Dynamic obstacles (moving targets).
- Expand the disaster scenario with additional elements.
- Refactored menu system
