# CoppeliaSim V4.6‚ÄìV4.9 Understanding and Programming Guidance

This project is focused on building a **simulation-based dataset generator** using **CoppeliaSim V4.9+**, intended for future use in drone navigation via machine learning. The AI component is not being developed at this stage ‚Äî the priority is to create clean, modular tools for simulation, data collection, and environmental setup.

Provide guidance for programming in **CoppeliaSim V4.9**, with strict reference to the **manual and API documentation stored in the `docs/` directory**. Follow clean modular practices, including the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** and the **Golden Principle**, and utilize the files provided under **Project Files**.

## üî∑ Project Overview

This simulator replicates a drone hovering above an H-shaped platform with dynamic and static obstacles. The goal is to create a labeled dataset using RGBD data from a simulated onboard camera for future use in AI training.

## Key Documentation Resources (Mandatory Usage)

üìÇ You **must use the official documentation files stored locally in the `docs/` folder**. Do not rely on outdated, external or inferred behavior.

The `docs/` folder contains:

- API Function Reference (HTML or PDF)
- Unified Property System Overview
- Properties Reference List
- Version History Overview

If any information is missing, ask the project maintainer before making assumptions.

## Steps to Follow

1. **Reference Check**  
   Always verify functions, constants, and object properties against the local manual in `docs/`.

2. **Documentation Review**  
   Understand and adapt deprecated or modified features across versions.

3. **Property Usage**  
   Only modify/read properties listed in the official documentation in `docs/`.

4. **Code Snippet Inclusion**  
   When providing code:
   - Preceding Line
   - New or Modified Line
   - Following Line

5. **Utilization of Project Files**  
   Leverage and extend the shared Project Files (`event_manager.py`, `main.py`, `scene_manager.py`, etc.)  
   - Maintain a modular structure  
   - Respect file boundaries and separation of concerns

## üìÄ Code Design & Structure Guidelines

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
Each **module**, **class**, and **function** must perform **only one well-defined task**.

- Avoid mixing concerns (e.g., sensor logic and control logic in the same module).
- If a unit begins handling unrelated tasks, **refactor and isolate functionality**.
- Split large modules into smaller, testable components when boundaries blur.

> ‚úÖ *Example*: `rgbd_camera_setup.py` should handle only camera setup and configuration.  
> ‚ùå *Anti-example*: A controller that also processes images and logs telemetry.

### 2. **Golden Principle ‚Äì Simplicity & Modularity**
Keep code **simple, readable, and easy to modify**:

- Use short, purpose-specific functions.
- Minimize deep inheritance and avoid overengineering.
- Prefer composition and separation of concerns.

> ‚úÖ *Example*: A separate `DroneControlManager` that receives discrete commands.  
> ‚ùå *Anti-example*: One class that controls, senses, logs, and reacts.

### 3. **Commenting Policy**
Use **comments only when they add meaningful value**. Unnecessary comments should be avoided.

- Favor **self-explanatory code** over explaining what is already obvious.
- Add comments for:
  - **Non-trivial logic or optimizations**
  - **Workarounds or known limitations**
  - **High-level documentation blocks at module/function entry points**

> ‚úÖ *Good*:  
> ```python
> # Normalize depth map to range [0, 1] before feeding to model
> normalized_depth = depth_map / max_val
> ```
>
> ‚ùå *Bad*:  
> ```python
> # Add 1 to i
> i += 1
> ```

---

## Mandatory Compliance Rules

- ‚úÖ Only use functions and properties described in the **`docs/` manual**.
- ‚úÖ Do not reference undocumented or deprecated features unless they are explicitly noted.
- ‚úÖ Stay within the architectural conventions provided in this guidance.

- ‚ùå Forbidden to use undocumented APIs, internal-only extensions, or Lua server-only commands.
- ‚ùå Forbidden to guess or introduce undefined behavior.

---

## Notes and Expectations

- Use the **Version History (in `docs/`)** when updating scripts or features across CoppeliaSim versions.
- Carefully refactor deprecated calls using the official guidelines.
- Code must be:
  - **Context-aware**
  - **Modular**
  - **Readable**
- Favor many small, purposeful files over large, cluttered modules.
- Follow these practices:
  - Consistent naming
  - Minimal viable complexity
  - Clear function responsibilities
- **Always build upon and cleanly update the Project Files.**
